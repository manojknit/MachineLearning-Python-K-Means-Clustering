# Machine Learning Python K-Means Clustering

This example explains k-means clustering with Python 3, pandas and scikit-learn on Jupyter Notebook.
## Requirements
To use this example you need Python 3 and latest versions of pandas and scikit-learn. I used Anaconda distribution to install.

### Data Set:
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2010-census-populations-by-zip-code

### ML life-cycle:
1.	Business objective connected to it.
2.	Data set, wrangle and prepare it.
3.	What the data is saying

## Algorithm
1.	Randomly pick K cluster centers(centroids). 
2.	Assign each point to closest center. By geometry join 2 centroid and devide by perpendicular line to identify closest.
3.	Select the new centroid by taking the average of Euclidean distances of all the points assigned to that cluster.
4.	Repeat 2 and 3 until clustor assignment stop changing.
